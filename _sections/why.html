<!-- <h3>¿Why Artificial Intelligence?</h3> -->
<p style="text-align:justify; padding-left: 50px; padding-right: 50px;">
I've always enjoyed <i>automating</i> things, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the essence of automating <i>hard tasks</i>.
<!-- <br> -->
A hard task is one that <i>you</i> as a human can carry out, but have trouble in teaching a digital computer to, perhaps because there is no “perfect” procedure for it, or because the thought process required for solving it is complex and unclear, even to you.
<!-- Consider, for example, recognizing whether or not an image contains a panda. -->
<!-- undetermined tasks -->
 <!-- allows the automation of undetermined tasks -->
Machine Learning, today's primary enabler of AI, seeks the solution in <i>data</i>; in fact, data has the answers to many hard questions, and oftentimes you just have to word your questions in the right way.
<!-- Hard tasks are everywhere, from diagnosing COVID-19 from audio recordings to ... . -->
</p>
<!-- The thing is, data being a <a href="https://seedscientific.com/how-much-data-is-created-every-day/" target="_blank">rapidly</a> growing asset opens up to all kinds of opportunities for automation, but also risks. -->

<!-- One of the my contrasting pollution in Emilia-Romagna , and then use the expertise for sustainable goals. -->
