<b>Doing</b> stuff can be entertaining... or not. But <b>automating</b> stuff is quite likely to be entertaining! 🗿
Automating something forces you to understand it deeply, which is a great exercise for the mind!
Best part is, if you automate something that was not entertaining to do in the first place, now you can choose to
never do it again, and instead spend your time with your loved ones 😁!

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the essence of automating <i>hard tasks</i>.
A hard task is one that <i>you</i> as a human can carry out, but have trouble teaching a digital computer to perform, perhaps because there is no “perfect” procedure for it, or because the thought process required for solving it is complex and unclear, even to you.
Machine Learning, today's primary enabler of AI, seeks the solution in <b>data</b>. Data has the answers to many hard questions... You just have to word your questions in the right way.
