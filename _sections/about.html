<!-- <b>TL;DR</b> -->
I'm an Italian student in computer science. Throughout 2015 and 2020, I've studied in Ferrara <img class="flag-img" src="gio/images/it.svg">, Gothenburg <img class="flag-img" src="gio/images/se.svg"> and Singapore <img class="flag-img" src="gio/images/sg.svg">, and I eventually specialized in <b>Machine Learning</b>. I'm now based in Ferrara, where I'm doing a PhD on <i>Interpretable</i> Machine Learning.
My daily job is to analyze data, run machine learning sessions, and try to improve some aspects of my algorithms.
<br />
<!-- <blockquote>Leave binarism to computers!</blockquote> -->

I like to <i>automate</i> things, and Machine Learning is the essence of automating hard tasks.
An hard task is one that does not have a formal definition of a correct solution.
Hard tasks are everywhere, from diagnosing COVID-19 from audio recordings to ... .
<br />

I will automate hard tasks for sustainability.
